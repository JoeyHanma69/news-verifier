Journal Note - AI Verification System (VerifyAI) 
02/08/2025 



About to write a idea that was presented by my classmates during my winter class. Im currently doing this as a fun project because this idea can be achieved and presented to anyone. Unfortunately, neither my team or my entrepreneurial tutor didn't want me to create it. So here I am, doing it. 

Manage to initialise the project: 
npx create-next-app@latest news-verifier --typescript --tailwind --app
cd news-verifier 


Manage to install the following dependencies: 
npm install ai @ai-sdk/openai zod lucide-react @radix-ui/react-progress 
npm install -D @types/mode
